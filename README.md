Iris Flower CLassification:
This project aims to build a classification model that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical dimensions. We utilize popular machine learning techniques and data visualization tools to achieve this.
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements.
This project implements a model which is trained to tell the name of the iris flower based on its measurements. Each flower has 4 measurements- Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Length based on which it is classified.
We import Matplotlib and seaborn modules for data visualisation. 
Scikit-learn module has a wide range of Machine Learninf algorithms which help in training the Model.
